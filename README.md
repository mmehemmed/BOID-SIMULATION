# Boid Simulation with Grid-Based Flocking Behavior

Welcome to the **Boid Simulation** project! üê¶ This is a fun, interactive simulation inspired by Craig Reynolds' "boids" model, where virtual creatures (boids) exhibit realistic flocking behaviors like cohesion, separation, and alignment. 

## üåü Features
- **Interactive Flocking Behavior**: Watch the boids flock together and interact! Each boid uses grid-based organization to detect nearby neighbors, simulating lifelike behaviors.
- **Mouse Tracking**: Boids are attracted to your mouse pointer, allowing you to steer the flock and explore different formations.
- **Grid Optimization**: The simulation divides the canvas into grid cells, making calculations efficient even with many boids.
- **Pause and Resume**: Press "P" to pause and resume the simulation, letting you examine each boid's movement closely.

## üéÆ Controls
- **Move Towards Mouse**: Move your mouse across the canvas, and the boids will follow along.
- **Pause/Resume**: Press the "P" key to pause and resume the boids‚Äô motion.

## üíª Technology
The project is built with **JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas API**. With minimal code, it achieves complex behaviors through efficient vector math and physics-based rules.

This simulation is great for learning how simple rules can create complex group dynamics. Experiment with the boids, and enjoy watching them as they flow across the screen like a real flock of birds or school of fish. Happy flocking!
